I am super excited about my application and can't wait to use it and for others to use it. For my third project, I created a Model View Controller Rails application that I call Travelers Social. This will allows travelers to write reviews on places they have visited. You can even rate the places with stars. Learning on my own how to acomplish putting the option to rank with stars, drop down menus, search bars and even coloring the font was more fun than I would have ever thought. Look at me now! My app constists of 4 models; users, state, country, and review. Users can sign up and create accounts and login via Google. I do use Active Record Validations to insure that no 2 users have the same username by using uniqueness and presence when logging in or signing up. Error messages will pop up in red when something is incorrect or already taken or not filled out. Users can also just take a look at the reviews without being logged in, but they cannot make a review, edit or delete until they are logged in. Once logged in, users can search through and find a state and write a review on it or a specific place there. Users can also add a state if it isn't listed yet. This was a super fun project to do, it really helped me better understand validations and methods within the model files and definitely DRYing up my code too, love doing that! Practice makes better and better!
