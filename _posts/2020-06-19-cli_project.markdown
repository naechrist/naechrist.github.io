Man o man, this project was great in all different ways. I am very happy now that I finally finished and got to see my work in action. Yes, there were a lot of headaches but totally went away when I realised that it wasn't as hard and my brain thought. The hardest thing was definatily finding the right website to scrape, I am still very confused on API's so I did not do that to myself. It took so many tries to find the right website. I do feel like I got better at google searching but then again, I couldn't find half of the things I needed through google so I could inprove on that for sure. I'm very glad that this project was so early on because a lot of things I learned really clicked as I actually put them to action. Which made me feel very good about this journey moving foward!
