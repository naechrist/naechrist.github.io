I have decided to make a site for travlers. I want to travel the world and this site will definitely help me! What I have always done when I hear about a place I want to visit it just add it to my list on my notes app on my phone. Now theres a website for that! This site lets you add a destination you want to visit and edit and delete once you have been there. I definitely would love to upgrade it in the future as I keep learning to make it even better! Using the Corneal gem was a LIFESAVER. This took off so much stress as it had a whole template done for me to start on the site. I learned a lot making this and stil want to go back through the lessons in prep for my review. I want to be confident in my work and grow everyday!
