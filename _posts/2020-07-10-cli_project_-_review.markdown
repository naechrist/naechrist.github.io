I was that girl who would be so terrified to go to the principles office, even when I knew I did absolutly nothing wrong. Once I would hear my name to go down there, my heart would start racing. That doesn't change as you get older, as soon as I didn't know the first answer, my heart starting racing. I know its okay to get things wrong and ask questions, but you keep telling yourself over and over you will get it and you do start to get it, but very slowly. But it can get so overwhelming that you just break down. The questions I didn't know seems so simple yet very important, the variables. How many different types of variabls are there in Ruby and how are they different? There are three different types; class, local, and instance variable. Class variables will start with '@@' and it belongs to a class. This is where we usually store everything in the class. Local variables are only available inside of a method, you cannot call that local variable anywhere else. Intance variables start with '@' and is available outside of methods. We use instance variables so we can call them in different files, such as from controller files to view files. These are very inportant in Ruby as I will be using them in pretty much all of my code. I am confident now that I can point out each different variable in code and know why there are there. Moving forward, I am going to keep learning and trying to lock everything in my brain as I go so I won't be so terrrified when I get called down to the principles office. :)
