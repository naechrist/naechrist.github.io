Software Engineering is the future. So many people have said it, sheeeh, I guess I have said it so many times now. I wanted to go into a field where there are endless possibilities and will not die out. It is everywhere! And I'd like to go everywhere!! I know that software engineering is challenging but also so very rewarding. It will give me the opportunity not only geographically, but professionally. Meaning, no matter where I am or what carrer I end up with professionally, there are endless possibilities. It will not limit by future on boundaries or financially at all! I am so excited to use these skills to live my best life, spread my wings out to all areas! The sky is the limit!
