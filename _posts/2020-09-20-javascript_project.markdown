Before I started this school, I did learn a little bit of JavaScript on my own online. I do not know what the heck it was now because this time around was completly different. This project really brought out a lot of emotions with just trying to understand every line of code I write. The more I drill it into my head the better it gets! I made a website for one to store their jokes for a show or just for themselves, a Joke Book. There is a random joke button when you're drawing a blank or just want a good laugh. You also have the option to select a category for that joke, such as a Yo Mama Joke or a One Liner or just maybe a Food Joke. There are plenty of options. I do want to continue on with this site later on down the road when I can do JavaScript in my sleep. And yes that is my goal :)
